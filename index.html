    <strong class="blue">Why Slack?</strong>
    <p>In CMSC434, you will be participating in a multi-phase, <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2017/cmsc434/project-overview.shtml" target="_blank">semester-long project</a>. There are plenty of communication tools out there, but for this class we decided to use Slack. Slack is one of the most powerful team communication tools currently available. Companies such as Samsung, LinkedIn, and Ebay all use Slack on a daily basis. Using Slack will support effectively communicating with your teammates and get a feel for a tool that most modern workplaces are using.</p>
